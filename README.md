# DataCleaningLayoffs
In this project, I am using 4 steps to clean the data in the layoffs table.
-- 1. Remove Duplicates
-- 2. Standardize the Data
-- 3. NULL Values or blank values
-- 4. Remove Any Columns or Rows
As you will see in the project, I ran into multiple issues that I had to troubleshoot and figure out. But in the end, I was able to accomplish the task and clean the data as best as I could.
